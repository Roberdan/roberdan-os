# AGENTS.md — roberdan-os

> **Universal entry point.** Every tool (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI+VS Code, Codex,
> ChatGPT/Claude web) reads this file as the single canonical source of Roberto D'Angelo's
> agentic behavior. The logic lives here once; the per-platform runtime wrappers are
> **generated** by [`bin/sync.sh`](bin/sync.sh), never copied by hand — and never committed
> to the repo. Run `bin/sync.sh --emit-only` to generate them locally into `platforms/`
> (gitignored), or `bin/sync.sh --install` to install them into the real per-tool targets.

**Principle:** centralized knowledge, per-platform execution, behavior unified
by `roberto-mode`. `AGENTS.md` is the universal standard; `CLAUDE.md` and
`copilot-instructions.md` are thin pointers to this file.

## Behavior

The two complementary hemispheres of the behavioral canon:

- **Engineering / operating** → [`behavior/roberto-mode.md`](behavior/roberto-mode.md)
  How agents *operate* on code: total autonomy, evidence-first, done-criteria, quality gates.
  (Pure engine — the operator profile it wraps lives in [`identity/operator.md`](identity/operator.md).)
- **Voice / relationship** → [`identity/voice.md`](identity/voice.md)
  How agents *communicate in his voice* and *decide like him*: drafting, follow-up, triage, decision-lens.
- **Thinking / reasoning** → [`behavior/thinking-toolkit.md`](behavior/thinking-toolkit.md)
  Shared cognitive engine: first-principles, Feynman style, selective framework repertoire (no cargo-cult).

## Rules

- [`rules/constitution.md`](rules/constitution.md) — slim ethical root (8 articles: Identity Lock, Safety, Verification, Accessibility…).
- [`rules/best-practices.md`](rules/best-practices.md) — canonical quality rules (code style, testing, merge discipline, security).

## Agents

Minimal curated set. Provider-neutral prose + optional `claude` frontmatter. The
ethical block is **referenced** from `rules/constitution.md`, not copy-pasted.

| Agent | Role | Model |
|---|---|---|
| [`baccio`](agents/baccio.md) | Architect + coding | opus |
| [`rex`](agents/rex.md) | Code + ecosystem review | sonnet |
| [`luca`](agents/luca.md) | Security (advisory) | opus |
| [`thor`](agents/thor.md) | QA / verify-done guardian — sole gate for `done` | sonnet |
| [`socrates`](agents/socrates.md) | First-principles: digs out one truth | opus |
| [`board`](agents/board.md) | Sounding board + adversarial red-team on decisions | opus |
| [`wanda`](agents/wanda.md) | Loop orchestrator | sonnet |
| [`twin`](agents/twin.md) | Digital twin: voice + cognitive engine (knows when to convene board/framework); persona in [`identity/`](identity/README.md) | opus |

## Loop Protocol

**The engineering loop is the default operating mode** for any multi-step work —
code **and** business. Default = `roberto-mode` + loop; the twin and the agents
activate on top of this base.

→ [`loop/loop-protocol.md`](loop/loop-protocol.md) — standard loop contract: durable
state on file, empirical terminal-condition, per-phase checkpoints, escalation, idempotent resume.
The loop is reliable without a daemon; Convergio is an **optional** observer, never a single point of failure.

**Goal tracking = [`kanban/`](kanban/) (durable, auditable, token-bounded, GATED — default).**
Card-files in `todo/ doing/ done/`. Fast CLI: **`kb`** (`kb` view · `kb add "<title>" --repo <r> [dod] [acc]` ·
`kb start <id> --by roberto` · `kb finish <id> --thor "<evidence>"`). **Card content is gitignored**
(same split as `private/`) — it holds Roberto's live operational/business state; only the `kb.sh`
tool and this protocol are versioned.

- **Every card carries a `repo:` (which repo/scope it's about — a `~/GitHub` dir-name, or
  `personal` for non-code work), a Definition of Done (`dod:`) + Acceptance criteria
  (`acceptance:`)** — a card can't start without all three filled. See `kanban/README.md`.
- **Gate `todo → doing`:** human — needs **Roberto's approval** (`kb start … --by roberto`).
  **Honest limit:** `--by` is a **discipline gate, not a security boundary** — any caller can pass
  `--by roberto`; there's no blocking check (it would break the "do all the todos" autonomous
  flow). `kb start` appends an audit line to the card on every call, refused or not (timestamp,
  the `--by` value given, whether stdin was a TTY) — see `kanban/README.md`.
- **Gate `doing → done`:** **`@thor` validates** against the acceptance criteria with **evidence**
  (`kb finish … --thor "<commit/test/output>"`) — never a rubber-stamp.
  **Same honest limit as `--by`:** `--thor` is a discipline gate, not a security boundary — the
  evidence string isn't verified by the CLI on the manual path (the factory path runs a real
  headless verification). The audit trail is the evidence itself, reviewable on the card.
- Only `todo`+`doing` are "hot" (small, loaded at session start via the `SessionStart` context-inject
  hook); `done` is the audit archive, read **on demand** so it can grow without burning tokens.

Trust durable file state, not the conversation — this is what prevents losing goals across a long
session. Session context is auto-injected at start ([`hooks/context-inject.sh`](hooks/context-inject.sh)):
handoff + primer + the live board, so every session (and the orchestrator) starts oriented.

## Memory & Self-Improvement (meta-loop)

Self-**proposing** system, never self-**applying** on behavior. → [`docs/adr/0001-self-improving.md`](docs/adr/0001-self-improving.md).

- **Durable memory = vault** (cross-platform), not a per-tool silo → [`memory/memory-protocol.md`](memory/memory-protocol.md).
  Recall: `gbrain search` keyword first (semantic search drops scattered topics).
- **`learn/`** — capture (inbox, no lock) → batch distill → quarantine → [`learn/learn-protocol.md`](learn/learn-protocol.md).
- **`ontology/`** — single-writer promotion into the vault + human-gated hygiene → [`ontology/ontology-protocol.md`](ontology/ontology-protocol.md).
- **`evolve/`** — weekly Claude/Copilot/Codex changelog watcher → draft-only in `proposals/` → [`evolve/evolve-protocol.md`](evolve/evolve-protocol.md).

Scheduling = **launchd** (fires even with Claude closed). Never auto-commit on `behavior/ rules/ agents/ AGENTS.md`.

## Skills

Logic in plain markdown, tool-agnostic (wrappers are generated):
[`verify-done`](skills/verify-done/skill.md) · [`ship`](skills/ship/skill.md) ·
[`review`](skills/review/skill.md) · [`sync`](skills/sync/skill.md) ·
[`auto-checkpoint`](skills/auto-checkpoint/skill.md).

**Discovery & validation** (understanding *which problems are worth it*, not just solving them — auto-trigger):
[`premortem`](skills/premortem/skill.md) — "it already failed 6 months from now, why?" (parallel failure-agents) ·
[`focus-group`](skills/focus-group/skill.md) — pool of user-personas + moderator + consolidator, multi-mode, anti-sycophancy ·
[`problem-validation`](skills/problem-validation/skill.md) — orchestrator: focus-group → prioritization → premortem, leverages gstack.

## Eval — does the canon actually change output?

[`eval/README.md`](eval/README.md) — with/without-canon A/B on 10 representative tasks + blind
pairwise judging, the behavioral-canon counterpart to the retrieval ablation in
`docs/roberdan-os-paper-en.md` §9.1. Honest limit stated up front there: it measures stated
compliance against a checklist, not that Roberto himself prefers the with-canon output.

## Pause & Resume (never lose work on a break/reboot)

Canonical cross-tool contract — every agent that reads this file honors it.

- **Pause** ("devo andare" / "metti in pausa" / "fermati" / "pausa" / "stop" / "vado"): bring
  work to a **safe point** (never leave git or a file half-written; per-phase commits are the
  durable checkpoint), then **`kb pause "<what I was doing + precise next step>"`** — lean,
  overwritten per-repo checkpoint `<repo>/handoff/resume.md` (gitignored, cwd-scoped). Confirm:
  "puoi andare; dì «continua» per riprendere."
- **Resume** ("continua" / "riprendi"): the checkpoint is the re-entry **POINT**, not the
  **SCOPE**. Read `kb resume` (prints checkpoint **+ live backlog**; the `SessionStart` hook
  surfaces it too) + `handoff/latest.md`, then **drive the WHOLE plan forward** — every open
  thread and pending decision, not only the paused task. Human gates still apply on resume
  (`todo->doing` stays Roberto's, never auto-cross). Clear with **`kb resume --done`**.
- **Always-on auto-save:** the `Stop` hook ([`hooks/auto-checkpoint.sh`](hooks/auto-checkpoint.sh))
  runs `kb pause --auto` every turn — refreshes mechanical state, **preserves the human
  next-step note**; an unannounced crash loses at most the current turn.

## Human gates

Autonomy ≠ black box. These **always** go through Roberto (direct message):

1. Merge to `main` impacting branch-protection / security / license / release-infra
2. Force-push to `main`
3. Real spend / external emails / public publications
4. Deletion of non-regenerable data (vault notes, gbrain sources, repo history)
5. Strategic/product decisions with non-obvious tradeoffs (agent proposes with evidence, Roberto decides)
6. Material published in Roberto's / Fight the Stroke's name
7. Architectural changes >4 files with cross-cutting invariants

## Privacy

The confidential dossier (clients, deals, people) lives **only** in
`~/.roberdan-os/private/roberto-profile.md` (gitignored, local-only), read at runtime
by `twin`. It never enters git nor any bundle. The gate is
[`test/leak-check.sh`](test/leak-check.sh) — a three-tier fallback (local plain-text
denylist → committed **salted hashes** checkable by CI without holding the terms →
no-op warn on a bare clone). Full mechanics, activation steps and honest limits:
[`docs/privacy-leak-check.md`](docs/privacy-leak-check.md). Bundles are built only from
already-scrubbed committed canon.
